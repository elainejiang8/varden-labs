<h1>The idea</h1>

        <p class="mainDescription">
            Safe and efficient on-campus transportation is imperative for any university, yet it is a problem that is too often solved poorly. <a href="http://vardenlabs.com/">Varden Labs</a> hopes to provide colleges with a much better on-campus transportation process through the use of autonomous, self-driving vehicles. For a class project, our group designed an App that will implement Varden Labs’ ground-breaking concept, allowing students and faculty alike to order a vehicle to pick them up, and bring them to their destination quickly and securely. 
<br><br>
        </p>

<h1>Process</h1>

        <p class="mainDescription">
We started our design process with paper prototypes. We had four designs, each having their own strengths and weaknesses, and tested these designs on twelve users (three users per prototype). We asked them to book a shuttle, revise their order, and cancel their order, to test any problems of the design. From this, we determined an ideal design and presented a new prototype on an online forum for further review. The feedback we received guided the design for our online prototype. Our users were most concerned with navigation, so from our initial designs to our final design, we tried to add as much clarity as possible for the user to book their shuttle, make any necessary changes, and cancel or confirm their order as necessary. We submitted this design on UserTesting.com and performed eyetracking tests to find other areas that could use improvements.

  		          <h3></h3>
  		          <p class="mainDescription"> The first main feature that the user interacts with after they open the app is a screen that asks the user to scan their student ID. We decided to include this scanning function because it would expedite the process of ordering the car, as the user would not have to manually input their personal information. To check that the scanned information is correct, the next screen presents the information to the user. On this page, the user has the option to change any information that may have been wrongly scanned in. and if they are satisfied with the personal details that are presented to the the user can proceed to ordering the car.

                <h3></h3>
                <p class="mainDescription">
                  After verifying the information, the next main feature that the user is exposed to is a screen that lets the user choose which type of vehicle they want to pick them up. This screen details the vehicle’s type, name and capacity as well as presenting the user with a picture of the vehicle. The user can scroll through the different vehicle options by means of an easy to use picker wheel. If the user is satisfied with their selection, they can then move on to selecting the pickup and dropoff location of the vehicle. Additionally, we gave the user the option to be able to go backwards in the app and edit previous screens.

                <h3></h3>
                <p class="mainDescription">In order to determine the optimal pickup location for the user, we used a feature which displayed the user’s current location relative to all the possible pickup locations. Thus, we allowed the user to tap on one of these locations to choose their pickup locations. We also used a similar map to allow the user to select the desired drop off location, which can be chosen from all possible drop off locations on the map.

                <h3></h3>
                <p class="mainDescription">We ended the selection process by asking the user to select the pick up time. We used a wheel picker to implement this feature. At the end of the process we confirm the user’s order by displaying on the screen the relevant trip information. This information includes the user’s name, vehicle, pick-up location, pick-up time and drop-off location.

                <p class="mainDescription">After the initial user feedback from our Wizard-of-Oz study, we decided to add a confirmation page so that users can go back to any previous screen and edit their information. Once the user confirms, they will be lead to the summary page.

                <h3></h3>
                <p class="mainDescription">After our initial hi-fi prototype, we received feedback from users who thought that it would be nice to be able to save the ID information for the user so that the user only has to scan their ID once. Thus, we made a separate Home page that the user will see after the first-time visit. This will make the booking process more efficient and convenient.

	<h1>Next Steps</h1>

        <p class="mainDescription">
An interface is always changing to suit the needs of the user and accommodate recent feedback. A few changes we’d make to our VardenLabs reservation interface considering the UserTesting and EyeTracking data would be to include an introduction page. A simple tap on this page would take users to the current first screen. Additionally, as per feedback recieved in in-class critiques, we slightly altered the color scheme of the app, darkening grays to increase contrast. This helps make our app more readable and thus more accessible.


In terms of the app, our interface is designed to be fully functional. VardenLabs currently does not have a reservation app available on their website. Because our interface was designed--and proved to be--simple and easily integrable, we believe that using such an app would be beneficial to organizations using self-driving cars.
